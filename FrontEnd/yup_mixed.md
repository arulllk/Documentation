  - **Mine Understanding**

    `.mixed()` in Yup as a "flexible" data type. It’s like saying, we can use this if we are adding custom validation for files like  file size and file type “

  - **Chat gpt explanation**

    Sure! Think of .mixed() in Yup as a "flexible" data type. It’s like saying, “This field can be anything.” It's the starting point for creating validation rules when you're not sure what kind of data you’ll be getting.  

    **Key Points:**
    - __General Use__: It can handle any type of data—strings, numbers, files, etc. You use .mixed() when you don’t want to limit the data type right away.
    s
    - __Custom Validation__: It allows you to add custom rules that don’t depend on the data type. For example, you can check if a file is too big or if a value is in a specific list of allowed options.                            
    - __Foundation for Other Types__: All other Yup types like .string(), .number(), .boolean(), etc., start from .mixed() internally. So, .mixed() is the base or "parent" type for everything else.
